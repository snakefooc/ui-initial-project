Project Template
========================================

#### _Because web development doesn't need to be a pain._

The [SnakeFooc](https://snakefooc.github.io) project template is the best way to build static sites fast.  With one command, build a static page using [Gulp][gulp], [Handlebars.js][handlebars], and [SCSS][scss].

## Features

- Install the project in just three commands (see "Developing" below).
- Use [Handlebars.js][handlebars] to keep our HTML organized into templates and partials.
- Use [SCSS][scss] to keep our CSS organized into logical components.
- Use [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer] to automatically insert browser prefixes where necessary to handle cross browser compatibility.
- Use [Browsersync][browsersync] to automatically launch a development version of our website, reload the page whenever we change the HTML, and inject changes to CSS, JavaScript, and images with needing to reload.
- Use [HTML Minifier][htmlmin], [CSSNano][cssnano], [UglifyJS][uglifyjs], and [ImageMin][imagemin] to compress and optimize our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, respectively.
- Use [SCSS-Lint][scss-lint], [JSHint][jshint], and [JSCS][jscs] to perform [linting][linting] and style checking on our SCSS and JavaScript files.

All with one command from the terminal:

```bash
gulp serve
```

## Setup

Install [npm][npm-install]. Then, install gulp:

```bash
npm install -g gulp  # May require `sudo`
```

## Developing

```bash
npm install            # One time
gem install scss_lint  # One time
gulp serve
```

## Reminders

If you want to use this repo for your next project, make sure to make the following changes:

1. Edit `data.yml`, filling in the HTML metadata associated with your site.
2. Edit `package.json` providing a `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, and `repository.url`.
3. Remove the `.git` folder, so that you start from a fresh commit history.
4. Edit `LICENSE.md` and `README.md` to your preference.

## Gulp Commands

An overview of Gulp commands available:

### `gulp build`

Builds the site into the `dist` directory.  This includes:

- SCSS w/ linting, sourcemaps and autoprefixing
- JS linting and uglification
- Handlebars to HTML

### `gulp build:optimized`

This is used for distributing an optimized version of the site (for deployment).  It includes everything from `gulp build` as well as:
- SCSS minification
- CSS / JS inline-sourcing 

### `gulp watch`

Watchs for changes in local files and rebuilds parts of the site as necessary, into the `dist` directory.

### `gulp serve`

Runs `gulp watch` in the background, and serves the `dist` directory at `localhost:3000` with automatic reloading using [Browsersync][browsersync].
